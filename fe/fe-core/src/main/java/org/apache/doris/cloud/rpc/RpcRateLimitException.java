 * Exception thrown when RPC rate limit is exceeded.
 * This exception is used to indicate that the rate limit for meta-service RPC calls
 * has been exceeded and the request cannot be processed.
 *
 * There are two scenarios for this exception:
 * 1. Too many waiting requests - when the waiting queue is full, requests are rejected immediately
 * 2. Wait timeout - when a request waits too long to acquire a rate limit permit
